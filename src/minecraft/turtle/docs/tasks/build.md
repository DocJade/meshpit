# build task

# NOTES TODO:
takes in a list of blocks and their positions and builds them

lots of care will have to be taken by the control computer on ordering to ensure that turtles dont trap themselves or others, and that they dont surround a block before they place it.

This will be very complicated. I will figure this out later.
